					<h3>
						A Week of New Beginnings and Creativity
					</h3>

					<h4>
						Day 1: The First Meeting & Introduction (FEB 03, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						Today marked the beginning of our journey with Iraya Energies! We had our first meeting with the employees and the CEO, Ms. Hilde, who introduced us to the company and its operations. The atmosphere was welcoming, making me feel comfortable from the start.
						As part of an icebreaker activity, we were asked to draw two objects in Figma that represent us. I chose a bowl of ramen to reflect my love for cooking and a cabinet to represent my woodworking hobby. It was a fun and creative way to share a bit about ourselves.
						Before wrapping up, we were given an example of the website we‚Äôd be working on, which provided a clear idea of our tasks ahead. The meeting ended around 5 PM, leaving me excited for the work ahead.
					</p>

					</div>

					<h4>
						Day 2: Moodboard Creation (FEB 04, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						I arrived at the university at 7:30 AM and completed my biometrics check-in by 7:55 AM. After taking a documentary photo, our team got to work on Iraya‚Äôs moodboard for the proposed system. Since there were last-minute changes to the color palette, we ended up creating two versions to accommodate different options. We wrapped up the task around 4:00 PM.
						This task was a great learning experience as it helped us adapt to client preferences, refine our design skills, and strengthen teamwork.
					</p>
					
					<h4>
						Day 3: Design Inspirations & Updates (FEB 05, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						Another early start‚ÄîI arrived at the university around 7:45 AM and completed biometrics by 7:59 AM. After my usual documentary photo, we reached out to Ma‚Äôam Hilde to update her on the completed moodboards.
						While waiting for her response, we continued searching for inspirational designs for the demo system we are set to develop. Exploring different ideas and layouts made me appreciate the depth of UI/UX design even more.
					</p>

					</div>

					<h4>
						Day 4: Power Outage & Remote Work (FEB 06, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						Today took an unexpected turn. I arrived at the university at 8:00 AM, checked in by 8:10 AM, and headed to NLP‚Äîthe office where we usually work. However, our professor informed us that due to a power supply issue and no internet connection, we should work from home instead.
						In the afternoon, we had a meeting with Ma‚Äôam Hilde, where she introduced us to our next task: Designing the Demo Page. After the meeting, my partner and I had a call to discuss our approach. By the end of the day, we had completed a few demo page designs, making good progress despite the work-from-home setup.
					</p>

					<h4>
						Day 5: Continued Work from Home & Blog Setup (FEB 07, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						Due to ongoing class suspension, we continued working remotely today. We focused on exploring more designs and color palettes to provide Ma‚Äôam Hilde with multiple options to choose from.
						In the afternoon, I began creating my internship blog site, where I will be posting weekly updates about our experience. This will be a great way to document our journey and showcase our progress throughout the internship.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							This first week at Iraya Energies has been a mix of excitement, creativity, and adaptability. From learning new design techniques to adjusting to unexpected challenges, every day brought valuable experiences. I‚Äôm looking forward to the upcoming weeks and seeing how our designs evolve!
							<br>
							Stay tuned for more updates! üìå‚ú®
						</p>

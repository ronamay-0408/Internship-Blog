					<h3>
						A Week of System Development: Progress and Challenges in Our Internship Journey
					</h3>

					<h4>
						Week 6: From Concept to Dynamic System ‚Äì (March 10 - 14, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						This week, our project took a significant step forward as we moved from conceptualizing the demo to actually building and refining the system. There were challenges, but also moments of triumph as we implemented key features and addressed issues that arose along the way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our week began with a meeting with Sir Louis, where we discussed the demo page we had completed the previous week. He asked us to demonstrate what we had done so far, such as adding products to make the page dynamic and allowing the admin to update each product. After answering his questions, we were given the autonomy to decide on the next steps, but we still sought his feedback on certain aspects. The meeting was brief, lasting only 15 to 20 minutes, and we were given the link to the demo page. Sir Louis emphasized the importance of embedding the demo page using an iframe, which we immediately began working on.
					</p>

					<p>
						Implementing the iframe wasn‚Äôt particularly difficult; however, we encountered an issue when we realized we had forgotten to add a table column for the iframe link. This minor oversight took some time to fix, but after an hour of troubleshooting and modifying the code, everything was up and running smoothly.
					</p>

					<p>
						The next day, on March 11, we tackled a new challenge: clarifying some design decisions with Sir Louis regarding the navbar. We needed to decide whether to replicate the existing system or use a link to redirect users to their page. After some discussion, Sir Louis advised us to stick with the static style that had been requested by Ma‚Äôam Hilde.
					</p>

					<div class="entry-thumbnail">
						<img width="800" height="533" src="OJT/March10-14-2ndRow.png" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="p1"/>
					</div>

					<p>
						Instead of deploying the system right away, my partner and I decided to clean up the system and refine its functionality. We replaced the use of links with packages, which made the execution smoother. We made significant progress but still had a few more aspects to work on before we could consider the system fully functional.
					</p>

					<p>
						By March 13, we were ready to move forward with hosting the system. We chose Hostinger for hosting, but the process wasn‚Äôt without its hiccups. Several bugs cropped up during the deployment, which delayed the process. Thankfully, we were able to resolve the issues by the end of the day, and the system was live.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, on March 14, we completed the hosting process and immediately reported it to Sir Louis. He asked us to meet with him online to demonstrate the system. We were relieved to hear that he liked what we had built. Not only was the system clean and responsive, but it was also functioning as intended. While there were a few minor adjustments to be made, these were easy fixes that didn‚Äôt take long to complete.
					</p>

					<p>
						However, just when we thought we were done, Sir Louis informed us that the demo would need to be presented on WordPress instead of the coded system we had developed. While we were initially disappointed, since we had put so much effort into the custom-coded demo, we understood that changes sometimes happen in the development process. We still had some time, so my partner and I decided to embrace the task and will begin transitioning the demo to WordPress on Monday.
					</p>
					
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							This week has been a whirlwind of development, troubleshooting, and decision-making, but it's been incredibly rewarding to see the system take shape. We're excited for what's to come as we continue to refine and prepare for the next stage of the project.
							<br>
							Stay tuned for more updates next week as we continue to push the boundaries of our internship journey! üöÄ‚ú®
						</p>

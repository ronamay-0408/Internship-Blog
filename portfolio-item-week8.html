						A Week of WordPress Development: Troubleshooting and Moving Forward
					</h3>

					<h4>
						Week 8: Troubleshooting the Demo Page and iframe Issues (March 24 - 28, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						This week was full of technical challenges, problem-solving, and some breakthroughs, as we continued working on the Iraya Energies demo page using WordPress and Elementor.
					</p>
					<p>
						We started the week with the completion of the demo page, where we were able to finalize the design with a few minor adjustments. However, the real challenge came when we tried to embed the demo's iframe. Our main issue was that we needed the iframe to be dynamic, as it had to reflect different products depending on the demo page. This became our primary focus for the rest of the week.
					</p>

					<p>
						By mid-week, we were working on finding a way to use a single iframe for both products. Without a database, this task proved to be more difficult than we initially expected. Despite the obstacles, we kept pushing forward, experimenting with different approaches to make the iframe work seamlessly for both product demos.
					</p>

					<p>
						On Thursday, we faced another setback with WordPressâ€”specifically, the navbar and menu. The latest version of WordPress seemed to have some issues with supporting the menu, which delayed our progress. We reached out to our mentor for advice and waited for their response while continuing to troubleshoot on our own.
					</p>

					</div>

					<p>
						Friday brought some relief as we decided to rebuild the demo page from scratch. This time, we were more familiar with the elements, which made the process faster. However, a new issue emerged: the Demo Page link wasnâ€™t redirecting correctly. Instead of going to the updated Demo Page, it kept redirecting to the old Sample Page, despite our best efforts to fix it. We were hopeful that we could resolve this issue the next day to be ready for a demo with our mentor.
					</p>

					<p>
						By the end of the week, we managed to resolve the issue and finalize the demo page, including the embedded iframe. After some trial and error, we discovered that creating a new page solved the redirect problem. We were finally able to get everything working smoothly, and we plan to demo the site to our mentor on Monday.

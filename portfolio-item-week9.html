					<h3>
						A Week of WordPress and Laravel Development: Progress, Troubleshooting, and Preparing for the Final Demo
					</h3>

					<h4>
						Week 9: Finalizing Demos and Preparing for CEO Presentation (March 31 - April 4, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						This week was all about final touches, troubleshooting, and preparing for our upcoming demo to the CEO. We made significant strides with both the WordPress demo page and the hard-coded version of the Iraya Energies site.
					</p>
					<p>
						We kicked off the week by reaching out to our mentor to give him an update on our progress. After a brief exchange, we scheduled a quick 10-minute meeting to demo the site. The demo was short, only lasting around three minutes, as we had completed two pages. Our mentor gave us positive feedback and confirmed that we were ready to present the design to the CEO. He also asked us to prepare a Bionote and suggested we also demonstrate the hard-coded version using Laravel.
					</p>

					<p>
						Despite the national holiday, we decided to keep moving forward. Although we weren't sure if we should be working, we used the day to host the WordPress demo page on Hostinger. We encountered a few minor issues, such as problems with the font not reloading, but we noted this as our task for the next day.
					</p>

					<p>
						Today, we focused on troubleshooting the issues with the WordPress demo page. After some digging and trial and error, we were able to resolve the bugs that had cropped up after hosting. It felt great to make progress on the site and get it closer to completion.
					</p>

					</div>

					<p>
						With the WordPress demo page successfully hosted, I also took the opportunity to tweak the hard-coded demo. I worked on modifying the header to match the design of Iraya Energiesâ€™ actual website, making it more polished and aligned with the overall brand. This task was completed efficiently within the day, and it was great to see everything coming together.
					</p>

					<p>
						Although it was another holiday, we kept pushing forward with both versions of the Iraya demo page. Both were now live on Hostinger, and we made some final adjustments to both versions. Afterward, we began preparing the PowerPoint presentation for the final demo to our CEO. The slide deck included our Bionote, the details of both the WordPress demo, and the hard-coded version. However, we weren't able to finish the presentation by the end of the day, as it was time to wrap up and head home.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Today was all about wrapping things up. We completed the PowerPoint presentation, making sure it was polished and ready for Mondayâ€™s demo. We reached out to our mentor to check if we could schedule the demo for Monday, as we were preparing for our graduation pictorial the next day. Fortunately, our mentor agreed, and weâ€™re now set for the final demo with the CEO!
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							It was a productive week filled with progress and a few bumps along the way, but weâ€™re ready to present the demo to the CEO and take the next steps. Weâ€™re excited about the hard work weâ€™ve put into both the WordPress and Laravel versions of the site, and weâ€™re looking forward to seeing how the final demo will be received.
							<br>
							Stay tuned for more updates as we wrap up the project! ðŸ“Œâœ¨

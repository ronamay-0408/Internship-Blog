						A Week of WordPress Development: Overcoming Challenges and Progressing Forward
					</h3>

					<h4>
						Week 7: Building the Demo Page with WordPress (March 17 - 21, 2025)
					</h4>
					<p>
						This week was a learning experience for us as we embarked on creating a demo page using WordPress. We encountered several hurdles but made significant strides toward overcoming them, refining our skills, and understanding WordPress better.
					</p>
					<p>
						The week started with our decision to use the online WordPress platform for ease of publishing the demo page. However, we quickly realized that we couldn't install plugins, which made building the demo page challenging. After consulting with Sir Louis, he suggested we switch to using WordPress locally. This decision took some time as we needed to learn how to install the necessary packages and set up WordPress locally.
					</p>

					<p>
						Once everything was installed, we jumped into building the page. But, like any new platform, WordPress had its learning curve. While we managed to install a few plugins, we found ourselves needing more time to familiarize ourselves with its features.
					</p>

					<p>
						The second day was spent learning and experimenting with different WordPress elements and styles. We began building the demo page by constructing containers like the header, navbar, and main section. Despite this progress, we still had some unresolved issues, including the responsive design, some color adjustments, and the full width of the site. Our main goal for the next day was to resolve these issues.
					</p>

					<div class="entry-thumbnail">
						<img width="800" height="533" src="OJT/March17-21-2ndRow.png" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="p1"/>
					</div>

					<p>
						By midweek, progress was slow due to continued learning. We spent time researching and testing plugins to improve the pageâ€™s navigation and functionality. This focus on learning helped us address some of the issues, but we werenâ€™t able to finish all tasks.
					</p>

					<p>
						On March 20, we were able to make noticeable improvements to the page design, especially the responsiveness. However, there were still plenty of elements to adjust and refine in order to match the demoâ€™s original design.
					</p>

					<p>
						On the final day of the week, March 21, we resolved the issue with the page width and improved its responsiveness. It took hours of trial and error, but by the end of the week, we were very close to finishing the demo page. While WordPress had its challenges, it was valuable practice, and weâ€™re now much more familiar with how it works.
					</p>
					
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Overall, this week was a steep learning curve, but it helped us develop skills that weâ€™ll carry forward into future projects. Weâ€™re excited to continue improving our work and tackling the next steps in our development journey.
							<br>
							Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build on our progress! ðŸš€âœ¨
						</p>
